<h2> Computer Security Tips: </h2>

1. <b>Use Security Software That Updates Automatically:</b> Keep security software, operating systems, and web browsers up-to-date to protect against new threats. Enable automatic updates and avoid buying security software from pop-up messages or unsolicited emails.<br>

2. <b>Treat Personal Information Like Cash:</b> Avoid sharing sensitive information unless necessary. Scammers can misuse details like Social Security, credit card numbers, and account information.<br>

3. <b>Check Out Companies:</b> Research companies before engaging with them online. Look for reviews and complaints to verify credibility.<br>

4. <b>Give Personal Information Over Encrypted Websites Only:</b> Stick to secure sites using HTTPS, particularly when banking or shopping online. Ensure the entire session is encrypted, not just the sign-in page.<br>

5. <b>Protect Your Passwords:</b> Create strong passwords (at least 10 characters, mixing letters, numbers, and special characters) and avoid using the same password for multiple accounts. Don't share passwords through phone, email, or text.<br>

6. <b>Back Up Your Files:</b> Safeguard important files by making copies on external hard drives or removable discs. <br>

<h2> Customer Account Takeover Awareness: </h2>

<b>Understanding Account Takeovers:</b> Know what customer account takeovers are and how they happen. Be aware of phishing attempts, social engineering, data breaches, and signs indicating potential account issues.<br>

<b>Signs of Account Problems:</b> Watch for unauthorized transactions, missing funds or documents, incorrect updates, and unfamiliar activities on your accounts. Use alerts provided by financial institutions to stay updated.<br>

<h2>Ways to Safeguard Your Accounts:</h2> 

1. <b>Watch What You Click:</b> Avoid clicking on suspicious links, emails, or attachments. Confirm information directly through financial firms' official websites or apps.<br>

2. <b>Use Strong Passwords:</b> Never share passwords, use unique passwords for each account, and change them regularly. Consider using a password manager for added security.<br>

3. <b>Enable Multifactor Authentication (MFA):</b> Utilize MFA wherever possible, as it adds an extra layer of protection.<br>

4. <b>Maintain Device Security:</b> Keep your devices updated with antivirus software, apply security updates promptly, and research cloud providers' security policies before using them.<br>

5. <b>Use Your Own Device Securely:</b> Prefer using your personal devices for financial transactions, and avoid public computers or insecure Wi-Fi networks.<br>

6. <b>Review Correspondence:</b> Regularly review account statements and activity alerts. Contact financial institutions immediately upon detecting unauthorized activity.<br>

<b>Additional Actions:</b> In case of a breach, change passwords across related accounts, report identity theft concerns, and place fraud alerts with credit bureaus.<br>

Remember, while financial institutions play a significant role in safeguarding your data, your proactive involvement and awareness are equally crucial in preventing cyber threats.
